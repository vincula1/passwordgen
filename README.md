# passwordgen

## Description

This is a password generator that asks you to specify the number of characters you want your password to have. It then prompts you to confirm the types of criteria you want to include in your password, such as numbers, lowercase and uppercase letters, and special characters. This showcases the advancements I've made in learning JavaScript during the boot camp.
